## Note On Days

Im counting the day I put the seeds in the pot as day 0.  
The seeds sprouted on day 3 meaning 3 days after I planted them.

## Light Info

Information on my current light the Spider Farmer SF-1000

## Grow Environment

* Starting lights 2.5 - 3.0 feet above
  * Currently set to 2 feet.
* Temp:
  *  <i class="green">Veg</i> : 70-85F
  *  <i class="purple">Flower</i> : 65-80F  
* Humidity
  * <i class="green">Veg</i> : 40-60%
  * <i class="purple">Flower</i> : 40-50%

## Water

* pH to 6.5 - 6.8
  * I think i pHed mine a little low, around 6.1-6.2 (
  * A little ph down goes a long way. <i class="green">noted</i>
  * 1 cap for 2 gallons of tap was too much
* Start with 1.5 oz of water to germ the seeds
  * I used a little more, ~2 oz
* Water sprout as needed the same way.
* Once sprouted (~ day 7), increase water, keep the top moist and start adding water to the tray to let the bottom soil hydrate
  * Jumped the gun here, watered them a bit too much at day 7. A quart each was too much.
* Water when dry

## Feeding

* Last top dress week 5 of flower
  * 45 days from seed?
* Re-amend around 20-30 days after germination
  * Slowly water after top dressing
* Top dress every 3 weeks after first
* Molasses: Can be feed anytime during the grow, as its for the microbe life in the soil, not the plant.
  * I watered in Molasses on day 7. 1 tsp to a 1/2 Gallon of water.
* When plants switch to flowering they will need less nitrogen and more phosphorus. 
  * I plan to make a compost tea with the Flower Girl and worm castings around the 30 day mark.

## Low Stress Training

* You can start LST when the plant has developed 4 nodes
* Repeat LST weekly by tying down new branches and adjusting old ties.
* Pony Tailing

## Defoliation

* You can start to defoliate after the first week of flower. No sooner tho as to prevent stressing and stunting the plant.

## Dark Period

* Before harvesting let plant rest in darkness for 24-48 hours.

## Drying

* Dry period 7-14 days
* Dry room environment 65-69 F
* RH 50-58%
* Buds should feel "crispy" and stems should snap when bent

## Trimming

* Trim over sifts to collect all that sweet sweet hash.

## Curring

* Burp jars a few times daily during the first week
* Once environment settles you only need to burp every few days
