## Week Three is a Wrap

Great week of progress, I posted that picture of Barney's Pineapple Express on day 15 from seed wishing my gals would keep up and they have, and I couldn't be more proud ❤️. 

### Blumats

I opened the valves just a hair (maybe half of one of the triangles on the valve) and that got the water dripping but it looked to be too much for the plants. They looked a little droopy yesterday so I dialed it back to around where it started and that has reduced the flow but its still dripping. The gals looked better for it today.

### New Light

I've been having a bit of buyer regret with my current MH TS 600W, and I'm still in the return window so it's going back!  
The TS600 just wasnt going to cut it for more than one plant in bloom, so its being replaced with a light that can handle two plants in flower. Enter the [Spider Farmer SF 1000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TS82HWB). This is the smaller version of the light Mr.Canuck (miss you bud) used in his most recent autoflower run that turned out great, so I used his coupon code and he got a little kick back and I saved a few bucks on a light my ladies are going to love. It should be here in the next day or two so they'll get a chance to get used to it before they start getting tied down.
