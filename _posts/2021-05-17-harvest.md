## Bruce was a Dude

Started LST on the BB on 5/3 and noticed something a little different from my first two plants. It looked like it was developing pollen sacks, but I wasnt 100% sure. Posted a picture on r/Autoflowers the next day and everyone confirmed it was a dude. So I killed it...

I started a Gorilla Glue Auto on 5/12 in the same pot.

## Harvest Time

### Pineapple Express, Day 81

On Friday, 5/14, I took the Pineapple Express out of the tent and into the closet for an extended 48 hour dark cycle. People say that the extended dark cycle allows for better rosin yields. This is because the plant produces its rosin at night so by giving your plant the extra dark time right before harvest you're supposed to be getting the best quality rosin. Having said all that, some folks say its all just "Bro Science" and the extended dark cycle is a waste of time. I have the time so why not try?

Yesterday 5/16, 81 days after planting the seed, I chopped the plant and hung it to dry in the same closet. Ideally the drying process will take between 10-14 days, then I'll do the final dry trim and get those nugs into jars to cure for 3-4 weeks. With that timeline I should be enjoying those buds by late June/early July.

## AK Still Going

After I took the PE out of the tent I was able to get a better look at the AK, it has a lot less tops and more less-developed buds, but the bigger buds all look great. I suspect had the PE not been as crazy and dominated the tent like it did that the AK would have had a better yield. It's still in the tent, with the GG seedling, I'm thinking I'll let it got a few more days before calling it and hanging it. I don't think I'll do the 48 dark cycle with this plant and just chop and dry.

## Run Two

Went to Brew and Grow yesterday and picked up 2 more bags DNC soil for the second run. I learned a lot this run and cant wait to see how round 2 goes. I plan on getting 2 Red Poison seeds into the tent this weekend, I'll be better about posting when that happens. I'm also planning on re-arranging the tent a little too.

### Dirt

I also picked up a "Tough Tote" from Home Depot to store the used dirt in after I remend it with new nutes and castings for a few months while the second grow is going and then cycle it back in for the 3rd grow and repeat with the soil I just bought after the second round finishes.
