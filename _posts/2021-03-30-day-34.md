## And We Back, And We Back

It was a fun little break from the apartment but I'm glad to be back with the gals. While it was only 3 days away from the plants, when I came back they were significantly larger and starting to show signs of early flower. Unfortunately the camera fell sometime between leaving the apartment and the plane landing a few hours later so I was in the "dark" for most of the trip. The cat sitter sent me a few pictures just so I could make sure they were still alive and healthy.

I wanted to post sooner but this is the first chance I've had since returning, the gals have needed some attention.

### Tea Time 🍵

Saturday night after getting home I filled a bucket and started aerating it for some tea. I ended up letting it go for about 16 hours (not the full 24 hours but I wasn't waiting till 1 am to start the tea) before making the tea. I then let the tea brew for about 26 hours (was aiming for 24 but I was busy). They each got a watering can an a half (probably close to a gallon) of the tea last night and the house plants got the rest. Im going to have some happy house plants.

The package for Flower Girl recommends mulching (aka: top dressing) the compost after feeding and I hate waste so I figured I'd try that. They each got about 2 Cups of tea "waste" each.

**Ingreditents**

* 2 TBSP Organic Molasses
* 2 Cups Worm Castings
* 2 Cups Flower Girl
* 2 TBSP Homegrown

### Light Height

The gals are really starting to stretch so I raised the light as high as I could, about 21" from the top of the canopy, and set it to 100%

### Blumats

The gals drank about 4 liters of water over the 4 days I was gone, which is about how much they have been drinking over the past week or so. While I was tending to the plants on Sunday I noticed the line feeding the blumat in the Pineapple Express pot was kinked but still dripping (thankfully). Once I fixed the kink water started flowing at a pretty high rate so I dialed it back to a drip.

Before the tea feeding I closed the blumat valves so they would stop dripping completely, I plan to reset them either later today or tomorrow after the plants have absorbed most of the moisture.

### Bug Update

I'm pretty sure the gnats are just here to stay, its just a matter of staying on top of them. The Jack attack last week seems to have helped substantially but hasn't completely removed the bug problem, still going to chalk it up as a win for the Captian Jack's. I'd likely have to apply Jack to all the house plants to really deal with the gnat issue, and thats just a lot of work...

### Low Stress Training Continues

I definitely missed some prime training time while I was gone, but thats the cost of taking time to take care of myself. The branches feel a bit more stiff and firm and I almost lost a branch on the Pineapple Express trying to tie it down. The PE is really stretching out and has benefited the LST. The AK just wants to be a bush...

One downside about the blumats is not being able to move the pots out of the tent for better accessability when training. I think this can be partly mitigated with a slight reconfigure of my set up so I can open the tent door on 3 sides of the tent. 

### Am I MephHead Now?

Managed to score a 3 pack of Grape Walker Kush from Mephisto Genetics yesterday, can't wait to get them in. Mephisto is considered a top tier autoflower and their seeds aren't the easiest to get a hold of. I likely wont run them until my 3rd grow so I have a bit more experience under my belt before popping top of the line seeds. Round two is likely going to be a Red Poison and the Gorilla Glue.
