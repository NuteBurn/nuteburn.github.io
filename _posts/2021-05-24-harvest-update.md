## AK Day 89

Yesterday I defoliated the AK and put it back into the tent for its last few hours of light before an extended dark cycle. I know I said I probably wasn't going to do that for the AK, but again I figured why not. Tomorrow night (day 90) I'll chop it down to hang in the closet with the PE to start drying.

The PE is still drying, the smaller stems are starting to get brittle and are close to snapping when bent. I plan to trim the PE this weekend (either day 13-14 of drying) and get it into jars before I leave for a few days on a camping trip üèïÔ∏è.

## Outdoor Day 12

The Gorilla Glue has been outside since Saturday (Day 10) and has been loving every second of it. Theres no longer a risk of frost this late into May so she'll be staying out on the porch fulltime. I'm not 100 sure how I'll handle watering it while I'm gone but its still tiny enough that it doesn't need a full watering yet so I may just give the pot a good watering and pray its okay in the sun alone for a few days. 

## Run 2

I didn't end up starting the Red Poison this weekend because of the camping trip. I don't want to leave seedlings that young alone for a few days. I'll likely pop them the day before leaving so when I get back they'll have just sprouted, hopefully.

## NASC Holding It Down

I reached out to NASC about the male Bruce Banner(RIP) and they hooked me up with 3 Northern Lights autos for free!
