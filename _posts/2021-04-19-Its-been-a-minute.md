## Who has the time?

It's been a few days, sorry... It's also a lot less exciting to post when one of the ladies is struggling.

## Indoor Update Day 54

The Pineapple Express is a moody bitch. I can't keep it happy. Between the light burn, nitrogen deficiency, and who the hell knows what else, it just wants to fight me. All the deficiencies have me thinking it might be a pH issue, but the AK is just cruising and chunking up those flowers. The PE is also a bigger plant with more tops, so I wonder if it just used up all its reserves. I really don't want to have to mess with soil pH testing but I may need to buy a soil testing kit if these deficiencies don't clear up.

### Flower Girl Tea

I brewed a bucket of Flower Girl and worm casting tea for the ladies last week and feed them this past weekend.

- ~2 cups of Flower Girl
- ~2 cups of Castings
- 2 TBSP Molasses
- 3 TBSP Garden Lime

I was a little afraid that the light burn on the PE caused it use up its available calcium so I bought some garden lime to mix with the tea and soil. The lime should help buffer the soil to a slightly higher pH, which might be part of the nutrition issue.

Friday night right before lights out I applied the tea as a foliar spray to get those nutes to the plant quickly, then Saturday I watered the tea into the pots, and on Sunday I top dressed them with the spent tea materials. All of this should address any deficiencies that might have been in the soil, and I'm hoping if it was a ph issue that the lime will help correct that. 

### Harvest Dates

The AK is 'due' to finish up around May 1st, that might happen but it would be a crazy two weeks of growth to get there on time.
The PE isn't even going to come close to finishing around May 3rd, I feel like its going to take another month easy, probably because its been so stressed. <i class="orange">My bad...</i>

## Bruce Banner Day 9

The Bruce sprouted day 3, 4/13. It was tucked into the corner of the tent and not getting very much light so its a little stunted and leggy. It needed more light to grow so I had to get creative, on Thursday(4/15) I pulled the Bruce from the back of the tent, opened the tent up and put the BB on a box closer to the light.

The tent will stay open until I can get this little guy outside. I was hoping around the 2 week mark once it developed a few nodes and some nice leaves, but theres no telling how long now as the plant is already behind where it should be, sorry little lady... It's not ideal but it works. <i class="purple">I need more grow space.</i>

I planted some Crimson Clover in the pot with the Bruce, yesterday, as a cover crop so when its outside the soil isn't totally exposed. Clover is supposed to be a nitrogen fixer too, meaning it adds nitrogen to the soil over time. I've read this actually takes a long time though and the clover may not actually add much nitrogen over the short life cycle of cannabis. I figured I'd try and it might be pretty!

## Lights

Sometime last week (I think it was Wednesday, 4/14) I chickened out and went back to 18/6. I couldn't stand seeing the PE burn like that and knew something else had to be done. I hope this decreased its Daily Light Integral(DLI) and stops stressing the PE out.
