### Second Tea

I brewed up some tea Thursday night for the gals, I only brewed 3 gallons this time so I just added a little less of everything. I didn't adjust the blumats this time because they should only drip when the soil moisture dips below where they're dialed in to, <i class="orange">in theory</i>. I gave them both 1 watering can of tea and then fed some of the house plants and came back and slipt another water can worth between them. That might have been too much liquid for them though, they still look a little droopy today. I wanted to get those nutes in there, I hope it pays off in the long run.  I may try to brew them another tea next weekend. Flower Girl, castings, and molasses only though so I don't over do it.

This is what the tea looks like after 24 hours of brewing. You can see it really does come alive even with my crappy pump.

### Flower Girls

They look great, I promise, their buds look like tiny hairy nugs. I just haven't had time to upload pictures, I still need to streamline that process.

## Outdoor Run

### Bruce Banner Day 0

I mixed up a soil of some things I grabbed at Home Depot last weekend. I wanted to keep it a really low budget run, hence using the freebie outside. I still plan to use a "craft" soil from the hydro store for indoor runs.

__Rough Recipe__

- Natures Care Organic Potting Mix
- A few scoops of organic coco coir
- The use compost from the tea
- A few scoops of fresh worm casting
- A light sprinkle of all 3 Dr Earths
- 1/2 cup of tea

I made sure not to plant this seed as deep as the first two, and added about 2oz of tap water on top to start the germination process.  

She's currently in the tent with one of the domes on top, for the extra humidity. I plan to transition the pot outside once the plant's a few weeks old. I'm thinking to "harden" the plant, before giving it the Sun's intensity, I'll keep it in the shadow of the banister for a week or so.
