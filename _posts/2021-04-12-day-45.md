## Second Tea

I brewed up some tea Thursday night for the gals, I only brewed 3 gallons this time so I just added a little less of everything. I didn't adjust the blumats this time because they should only drip when the soil moisture dips below where they're dialed into, <i class="orange">in theory</i>. I gave them both 1 watering can of tea each and then fed some of the house plants and came back and slipt another water can worth between them. That might have been too much liquid for them, they still look a little droopy today, but I wanted to get those nutes in there. I hope it pays off in the long run. 

I may try to brew them another tea next weekend, but we'll see.

## Outdoor Run

### Day 0

I mixed up a soil of some things I grabbed at Home Depot last weekend. I wanted to keep it a really low budget run, hence using the freebie outside.

 __Rough Recipe__
 - Natures Care Organic Potting Mix
 - A few scoops of organic coco coir
 - The use compost from the tea
 - A few scoops of fresh worm casting
 - A light sprinkle of all 3 Dr Earths

She's currently in the tent with one of the domes on top, for the extra humidity. I plan to transition the pot outside once the plant's a few weeks old. I'm thinking to "harden" the plant, before giving it the Sun's intensity, I'll keep in the shadow of the banister for a week.
