## GNATS!

<i class="organge">Fuck gnats.</i> I didnt get them all when I treated last time and they let me know. The sticky traps are helping but I'll definitely have to reapply Captain Jack's in the next few days, the bottle says to wait around 7 days before reapplying(yesterday). I'll give the ladies a few days to adjust to their low stress training(LST) though, before dumping a bunch of Jack's on the soil. I also sprinkled a good amount of Mosquito Bits in the trays and added water to let it soak up into the soil, hoping that helps.

The rest of the pests, including whatever was eating the inside of the leaves, seem to have been killed off. All things considered I'll say Jack's works.

## SF-1000

I thought the TS600 was bright... I need to get a pair of shades to work in the garden with the Spider Farmer in there now. I swapped out the light yesterday afternoon, overall the process took 15 minutes and the ladies were only lights out for 5 minutes. It's a noticeably nicer light and I'm glad I was able to fix that mistake before I was stuck with the TS600. 

Their information suggests keeping it 18-24" inches away from the plant in veg, I'm currently at 19" at 100%

Maybe I'll do the math to figure out the bump in their daily light integral (DLI)... but probably not.

## Blumat

I filled the reservoir up to 9 liters and dialed the valves back another half triangle, they're still dripping but its slowed down a lot. I'll keep my eye on the level over the next few days to see how much they drink, I'm hoping this will be the last of the adjustments.

## Low Stress Training

### Ponytails

I starting proper low stress training today, so last night marks the last night of that experiment. It ended up being around ~20 hours of direct light on the lower growth for each plant. I don't have another grow to compare but I think the lower growth benefited and it helped fill in the plant early in its growth.

### Tie Downs

This is what folks mean when they say low stress training, tieing down the tallest branch to force the plant to grow its other branches up towards the light. Unattended the plant would grow like this: ðŸŒ² we want it to bush out more like this: ðŸŒ³. Im hoping that ponytailing the top growth prior to this gave the lower growth a head start before this point. 

Here's what they look like after I was finished.
