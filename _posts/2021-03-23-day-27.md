## Vacation

Going out of town tomorrow until Saturday evening. I'm not nervous... 

### Blumats

I filled the reservoir well past its top marker at 13 liters, if I had to guess it was around 16 liters and I tested it pH just to be sure and it was at 6.2 - 6.3. Im optimistic that should last them the whole trip. 

### Bugs

I'll be applying Captain Jack's tonight before lights off, I'll apply much more to the soil this time as well. I've noticed something has been chewing on the leaves, I hope the second Jack attack will take care of it.

## Lights

The gals were also showing signs of light stress so I raised it about 2 inches to about 20" above the top growth and turned it down to 80%. The upper growth was starting to curl and some of the tips are starting to burn, though the burnt tips might be <i class="orange">nute burn.</i>

## Cam Girls

I put one of the cat cameras in the tent so I can keep an eye on the girls while I'm gone:

I've been able to pull down a few of the Pineapple Express(back) branches to expand the canopy over the past few days but it wasn't until this morning that I could do the same with the AK(front). The PE feels like it wants to stretch out and grow, while the AK feels like it wants to stay short and squat.
