## Shits Burnt Bro

The ladies must have thought they were Kanye and could [touch the sky.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkwQbuAGLj4)... Well to their credit, they were looking extra fly

But really, that flower stretch is real. The Pineapple Express was damn near touching the light and there was some serious signs of light burn on the leaves near the top.

I ended up tieing the light to the top of the frame to get every inch I could out of the tent. This was a bit tricky to do but it was definitely worth the extra head space. Also a great way to justify buying that paracord a year ago...

### Super Croped

Tried to super crop and pull over the colas that were still too close to light after raising it. There's nothing quiet as nerve racking as squeezing the biggest and best colas until the stems internal structure snaps so you can bend it. I wasnt sweating ðŸ˜…

Heres what they look like after I was done training:

## Bruce Day 2

Still nothing, maybe tomorrow?

I'm actually a little worried when it does sprout it wont get enough light because of the canopy.
