## Seeds For A Second Run

I just pulled the trigger on a 3 pack of {{ site.data.seeds['SSRPA'].mdlink }}, I couldn't resist the color. I'll likely run one of those with the Gorilla Glue from Barneys and keep the extra's on stand by. Maybe for when I get a second tent. <i class="green"> I can dream.</i>

## Day 5-6 Updates

I measured and took photos of the little babies yesterday but not much had changed, the Pineapple Express grew to about 1 inch (almost doubled in size) and the AK Auto grew around a half inch more as well (from 1 to 1.5 inches) so I didn't post.

I watered the pots a bit more this morning as they looked pretty dry, I gave them both about 1/2 Gallon of the last of that pHed water. I increased the water because I was afraid the soil would dry out too much and get hydrophobic ,which is a new thing I get to be worried about, great!

The gals were about the the same height as of 11pm but the AK has larger leaves.

## Blumats Ordered

Ordered a 5 "Carrot" pack from Blumat. I plan to use two per pot to keep the soil moist, this will be handy if I ever need to leave the apartment for a few days, and camping season is right around the corner. Its a gravity fed drip irrigation system that uses ceramic cones to monitor the soil moisture and allows the water to drop out if the soil needs it. As far as I'm concerned its magic. Once its installed and setup I'll write more about it.
