## It's Spring, Baby

It was a beautiful spring day today, low 80's, so I put the very leggy Bruce Banner outside for an hour and a half this afternoon to start the hardening process. I'll continue to increase the exposure, weather permitting, over the next few weeks until I move it outside full time. 2020's last frost was in mid May, if I end up transitioning the plant outside before then I'll need to monitor night time temps.

She's stretchy as all hell but I'm not worried about it, it should make for some interesting training.  

Depending on how this little porch project goes I may end up starting another this season.

## Flower Girls

Smells great in the lung room with the tent open! I'll be sad to zip it closed when the BB goes outside.

Between the issues with light burn, super cropping her, and potential nutrient lockout, I definitely stunted the Pineapple Express. My D62 looks nothing like Barney's at day 63(mine's not catching up in 24 hours..). She has put on some nice weight the past day or two so I think she's bouncing back.

### Less Tea can be More Tea

I made a small 2 gallon brew of Flower Girl, castings, and molasses this weekend and sprayed the plants. I know you shouldn't really spray in flower (if you don't want to smoke it, don't spray it on the flowers) but this is my first run and I'm just trying to do best for my girls so I'll take a hit in taste. They've both been doing really well so that may be the last foliar feeding.

I also fed them both a watering can full of tea and top dressed them with the spend castings, for good measure. I watered some tea down and feed the Bruce and the clovers as well to help the soil biology. The house plants got the rest of the tea.

### Harvest?

The estimated harvest dates from the breeders are 5/1(AK) and 5/3(PE), this weekend/monday...

The AK is good shape but its not coming down anytime soon(maybe 2 more weeks?). The Pineapple Express looks like it still needs another month, I suspect it will be closer to day 85-90 than the 65 they claim. 

### Getting Frosty ❄️
