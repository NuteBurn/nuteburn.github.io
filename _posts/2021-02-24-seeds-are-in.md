## Seeds Are In The Tent

I took some time this morning to mix up the soil, get it into the pots, and plant those little babies. Now the real work begins!
I followed the advice from a few folks with this run. I was sold on the living soil method by Canuck's Grow and Mr. Grow It for its simplicity and it's tendency to be forgiving to beginners. 
Mr Grow It mentioned that he, some times, likes to start his autos in Happy Frog thats surrounded by Ocean Forest(Fox Farms heavier amended soil mix) to help prevent <i class="orange">nuteburn</i>. That sentiment was repeated to me at Home & Brew so I knew it was a good place to start. 

After the bags were filled I poked a little hole ~1 inch in the center, dropped the seeds, lightly covered them and watered with 2 oz of 6.1 pHed water. Then I covered them with little pot liners I found at Home Depot to help keep the seeds moist while they germ. I lowered the light to about 2 feet above the soil to start. I'm thinking because its a lower watt light it will be a bit more forgiving while I figure this out.

## Soil & Amendment Mixture (Each)

* 1/2 Cubic Foot of DNC (1/2 bag)
* 2 Cups of Worm Castings (1.25-0-0)
